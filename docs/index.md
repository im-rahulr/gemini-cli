# Welcome to CodeCraft CLI documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and developing CodeCraft CLI. This tool lets you interact with Gemini models through a command-line interface.

## Overview

CodeCraft CLI brings the capabilities of Gemini models to your terminal in an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. CodeCraft CLI consists of a client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server (`packages/core`), which in turn manages requests to the Gemini API and its AI models. CodeCraft CLI also contains a variety of tools for tasks such as performing file system operations, running shells, and web fetching, which are managed by `packages/core`.
